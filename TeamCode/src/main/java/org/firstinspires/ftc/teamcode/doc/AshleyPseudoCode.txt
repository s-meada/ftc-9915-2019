We should already know:
- The location of the center of claw with respect to the location of the Webcam

1. Use Vuforia to get the location of the center of the skystone
2. Calculate the location of the center of the skystone with respect to the center of the claw (x, y)
3. Move robot forward/backward so that the center of the skystone is 1.5 inches to the right of the center of the claw 
4. Use the distance the robot is from the skystone to calculate how far arm needs to extend so that the claw is over the skystone
5. Move arm up so that the claw is above the skystone
6. Extend arm the calculated distance
7. Open claw
8. Move arm down (optimal distance to be tested)
9. Close claw
10. Move arm up so that the skystone is above the robot's chassis (and could fit inside robot)
11. Retract arm close to the arm's initial position
