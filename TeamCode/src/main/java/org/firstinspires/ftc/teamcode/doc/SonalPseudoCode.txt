Preconditions:
- the robot claw is gripping a skystone
- the robot is oriented vertically and with the side holding the skystone nearest to the foundation
- the foundation has already been moved
- the skystone is already above the foundation
- the alliance partner robot is leaning against the wall of the field in the building zone.

Goal: To release the skystone onto the foundation and move backwards to park.

Pseudocode:
The position of the arm extension motor changes so that the arm is extended.
The position of the arm angle motor changes so that the arm is lowered.
The position of the claw servo changes so that the skystone is released onto the foundation.
The position of the arm extension motor changes so that the arm is retracted.
The position of the arm angle motor changes so that the arm is raised to its original position before the process of releasing the skystone.
The robot runs to a position (backwards) in which the front of the robot is behind the horizontal position of the back of the foundation.
The robot strafes to a position to the right until it is a bit to the left of the vertical centerline of the building zone, out of the vertical trajectory of the alliance partner robot.
The robot runs to a position (backwards) until the color sensor senses red. 
The robot stops.
